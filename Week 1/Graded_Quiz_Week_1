Question 1
In computational thinking terms, breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more specific sub-problems is called ___________. 

1 / 1 point

Decomposition


Pattern Recognition


Problem Identification

Correct
Correct! Decomposition involves breaking a large, complex problem down into smaller sub-problems. 

2.
Question 2
True or False: Computational thinking techniques can help programmers conceptualize problems before they begin programming.

1 / 1 point

True


False

Correct
Correct! Before programmers begin the process of coding, computational thinking techniques help them to identify the proper computational questions, decompose problems into smaller problems, recognize patterns, and abstract any information that is less relevant. 

3.
Question 3
In computational thinking terms, framing a problem and determining if it can be solved by computers is known as _________.

1 / 1 point

Problem Identification


Pattern Recognition


Abstraction

Correct
Correct! Problem identification determines if a problem is solvable by a computer, and it helps frame the overall problem.

Question 4
While writing a program for building a cake, you decide that some information is less relevant for your particular program. For instance, you might decide that you don’t need to know the flavor of ice cream that the cake is being served with, and you don’t need to know what color plates the cake is being served on. In computational thinking terms, this process of ignoring or filtering out less relevant information is known as _______. 

1 / 1 point

Decomposition


Pattern Recognition


Abstraction

Correct
Correct! Abstraction is the process of filtering out less relevant information and focusing on more relevant information. 

5.
Question 5
True or False: When identifying a problem for a computer to solve, it is best to identify problems that are subjective or open-ended.

1 / 1 point

True


False

Correct
Correct! Computers work best when they are asked to solve problems that are specific and objective.

6.
Question 6
True or False: Computational thinking is a linear process. 

1 / 1 point

True


False

Correct
Correct! The computational thinking process is highly iterative and complex.
